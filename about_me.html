      <p class="px-3">I‚Äôm Nora Cha, a software development student passionate about
            clean code, problem-solving, and building efficient
            software solutions. I'm very grateful to have discovered my passion for software development, and excited to
            apply my skills and dedication to solving real-world challenges. Whether it‚Äôs programming, testing, or something
            entirely new, I‚Äôm always eager to learn and contribute!</p>

        <p>
          I'm currently pursuing an Advanced Diploma in Software Development at Mohawk College (Sep 2023 ‚Äì Present).
          With a GPA of 98.6%, I‚Äôm proud to be consistently recognized on the Dean's Honour List and to have received
          academic scholarships after every semester. These achievements reflect my commitment to excellence and my
          drive to continually improve.

        <p>
          As a Mathematics Tutor with Mohawk College since Feb 2024, I have the rewarding opportunity to support
          students in the Mathematics for Computer Studies course at St. Jean de Br√©beuf Catholic Secondary School and
          Cathedral High School as part of Mohawk College‚Äôs Early College Graduation Program (P-TECH). Helping students
          overcome challenges and succeed in their studies is incredibly fulfilling.

        <h3 class="h5">Beyond Codeüé≤</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>I love spending time with friends and family over a good board game, especially ones that challenge strategy
          and logic. Some of my favourite games include Splendor, Kingdomino, and Wingspan. As a Toronto Blue Jays fan,
          I also enjoy watching their games, even if it sometimes feels like an emotional rollercoaster (seriously, why
          do they do this to us?). Beyond that, I have a deep appreciation for nature, whether it‚Äôs observing birds in
          the wild or immersing myself in a fascinating nature documentary, I‚Äôm always eager to learn more about the
          world around us! I‚Äôm also passionate about working with youth and hope to inspire curiosity, creativity, and
          confidence in the next generation through mentorship and education.</p>
